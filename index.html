					<p>
						Whenever you see the function keyword within another function, the inner function has access to variables in the outer function.
					</p>
					<pre class="brush: js;">
						function foo(x) {
						  var tmp = 3;
						  function bar(y) {
							alert(x + y + (++tmp));
						  }
						  bar(10);
						}
						foo(2);
					</pre>
					<p>
					This will always alert 16, because bar can access the x which was defined as an argument to foo, and it can also access tmp from foo.
					</p>
					<blockquote>
					That is a closure. A function doesn't have to return in order to be called a closure. Simply accessing variables outside of your immediate lexical scope creates a closure.
					</blockquote>
					<p></p>
					<h4>Common uses of closures</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>The most common use is when someone wants to "delay" use of a variable that is increased upon each loop, but because the variable is scoped then each reference to the variable would be after the loop has ended, resulting in the end state of the variable
							</p>
							<pre class="brush: js;">
								for (var i = 0; i < someVar.length; i++) {
									window.setTimeout(function () { 
										alert("Value of i was "+i+" when this timer was set" )
									}, 10000);
								}
							</pre>
							<p>
							This would result in every alert showing the same value of i, the value it was increased to when the loop ended. The solution is to create a new closure, a separate scope for the variable. This can be done using an instantly executed anonymous function, which receives the variable and stores its state as an argument:
							</p>
							<pre class="brush: js;">
								for (var i = 0; i < someVar.length; i++)
								(function (i) {
									window.setTimeout(function () { 
										alert("Value of i was "+i+" when this timer was set" )
									}, 10000);
								})(i); 
							</pre>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>Emulating private methods with closures: </h4>	
							<pre class="brush: js;">	
							a = (function () {
								var privatefunction = function () {
									alert('hello');
								}

								return {
									publicfunction : function () {
										privatefunction();
									}
								}
							})();
							</pre>						
						</li>					
					</ul>	
					<h4>Performance considerations</h4>
					<p>
					It is unwise to unnecessarily create functions within other functions if closures are not needed for a particular task, as it will negatively affect script performance both in terms of processing speed and memory consumption.
					</p>
					<p>
					For instance, when creating a new object/class, methods should normally be associated to the object's prototype rather than defined into the object constructor. The reason is that whenever the constructor is called, the methods would get reassigned (that is, for every object creation).
					</p>
					<p>
					Consider the following impractical but demonstrative case:
					</p>
					<pre class="brush: js;">
					function MyObject(name, message) {
					  this.name = name.toString();
					  this.message = message.toString();
					  this.getName = function() {
						return this.name;
					  };

					  this.getMessage = function() {
						return this.message;
					  };
					}
					</pre>
					<p>
					The previous code does not take advantage of the benefits of closures and thus could instead be formulated:
					</p>
					<pre class="brush: js;">
					function MyObject(name, message) {
					  this.name = name.toString();
					  this.message = message.toString();
					}
					MyObject.prototype = {
					  getName: function() {
						return this.name;
					  },
					  getMessage: function() {
						return this.message;
					  }
					};
					</pre>
					<p>
					However, redefining the prototype is not recommended, so the following example is even better because it appends to the existing prototype:
					</p>
					<pre class="brush: js;">

					function MyObject(name, message) {
					  this.name = name.toString();
					  this.message = message.toString();
					}
					MyObject.prototype.getName = function() {
					  return this.name;
					};
					MyObject.prototype.getMessage = function() {
					  return this.message;
					};
					</pre>

					<blockquote>
					Rather than directly passing callbacks to functions, something which can lead to tightly coupled interfaces, using promises allows one to separate concerns for code that is synchronous or asynchronous.
					</blockquote>
					
					<p>
					Personally, I've found deferred especially useful when dealing with e.g. templates that're populated by asynchronous requests, loading scripts that have networks of dependencies, and providing user feedback to form data in a non-blocking manner.
					</p>
					
					<p>Indeed, compare the pure callback form of doing something after loading CodeMirror in JS mode asynchronously (apologies, I've not used jQuery in a while):
					</p>
					
					<pre class="brush: js;">
						/* assume getScript has signature like: function (path, callback, context) and listens to onload && onreadystatechange */
						$(function () {
						   getScript('path/to/CodeMirror', getJSMode);

						   // onreadystate is not reliable for callback args.
						   function getJSMode() {
							   getScript('path/to/CodeMirror/mode/javascript/javascript.js', 
								   ourAwesomeScript);
						   };

						   function ourAwesomeScript() {
							   console.log("CodeMirror is awesome, but I'm too impatient.");
						   };
						});	
					</pre>
					
					<p>To the promises formulated version (again, apologies, I'm not up to date on jQuery):</p>
					
					<pre class="brush: js;">
						/* Assume getScript returns a promise object */
						$(function () {
						   $.when(
							   getScript('path/to/CodeMirror'),
							   getScript('path/to/CodeMirror/mode/javascript/javascript.js')
						   ).then(function () {
							   console.log("CodeMirror is awesome, but I'm too impatient.");
						   });
						});
					</pre>
					<blockquote>
					The point of promises is to give us back functional composition and error bubbling in the async world.
					</blockquote>
					<p>In other word, promises are a way that lets us write asynchronous code that is almost as easy to write as if it was synchronous.
					</p>
					<p>Consider this example, with promises:
					</p>

					<pre class="brush: js;">
						getTweetsFor("domenic") // promise-returning async function
							.then(function (tweets) {
								var shortUrls = parseTweetsForUrls(tweets);
								var mostRecentShortUrl = shortUrls[0];
								return expandUrlUsingTwitterApi(mostRecentShortUrl); // promise-returning async function
							})
							.then(doHttpRequest) // promise-returning async function
							.then(
								function (responseBody) {
									console.log("Most recent link text:", responseBody);
								},
								function (error) {
									console.error("Error with the twitterverse:", error);
								}
							);
					</pre>
					<p>
					It works as if you were writing this synchronous code:
					</p>
					<pre class="brush: js;">
						try {
							var tweets = getTweetsFor("domenic"); // blocking
							var shortUrls = parseTweetsForUrls(tweets);
							var mostRecentShortUrl = shortUrls[0];
							var responseBody = doHttpRequest(expandUrlUsingTwitterApi(mostRecentShortUrl)); // blocking x 2
							console.log("Most recent link text:", responseBody);
						} catch (error) {
							console.error("Error with the twitterverse: ", error);
						}
					</pre>

					<blockquote>
					Regarding Deferred, it's a way to .resolve() or .reject() promises. In the Promises/B spec, it is called .defer(). In jQuery, it's $.Deferred().

						<strong>To delete a localStorage item</strong>
						<pre class="brush: js;">

						</pre>
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>What is a cookie?</strong>
						Quite simply, a cookie is a small text file that is stored by a browser on the user's machine. Cookies are plain text; they contain no  code. A web page or server instructs a browser to store this information and then send it back with each subsequent request based on a set of rules. Web servers can then use this information to identify individual users. Most sites requiring a login will typically set a cookie once your credentials have been verified, and you are then free to navigate to all parts of the site so long as that cookie is present and validated. Once again, the cookie just contains data and isn't harmful in and of itself.
					</p>
					<p>
					Cookies and local storage really serve difference purposes. Cookies are primarily for reading server-side, local storage can only be read client-side. So the question is, in your app, who needs this data — the client or the server?
					</p>
					<p>
						If it's your client (your JavaScript), then by all means switch. You're wasting bandwidth by sending all the data in each HTTP header.
					</p>
					<p>
						If it's your server, local storage isn't so useful because you'd have to forward the data along somehow (with Ajax or hidden form fields or something). This might be okay if the server only needs a small subset of the total data for each request.
					</p>
					<p>
						You'll want to leave your session cookie as a cookie either way though.
					</p>
					<p>
					</p>
					<p>
						Apart from being an old way of saving data, <strong>Cookies give you a limit of 4096 bytes</strong> (4095, actually) - its per cookie. <strong>Local Storage is as big as 5MB per domain</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>localStorage</strong> is implementation of Storage Interface - stores data with no expiration date, and gets cleared only through JavaScript, or clearing the Browser Cache / Locally Stored Data - unlike cookie expiry

						It's all about loose coupling and single responsibility, which goes hand to hand with MV* (MVC/MVP/MVVM) patterns in JavaScript which are very modern in the last few years.
					</p>										
					<p>
						So that you don't have to hardcode method / function calls, you just publish the event without caring who listens. This makes the publisher independent from subscriber, reducing dependency (or coupling, whatever term you prefer) between 2 different parts of the application.
					</p>					
					<p>
						Here are some disadvantages of coupling as mentioned by wikipedia
					</p>					
					<p>
						Tightly coupled systems tend to exhibit the following developmental characteristics, which are often seen as disadvantages:
					</p>					
					<ul>
						<li>
							A change in one module usually forces a ripple effect of changes in other modules.		
						</li>
						<li>
							Assembly of modules might require more effort and/or time due to the increased inter-module dependency.
						</li>
						<li>
							A particular module might be harder to reuse and/or test because dependent modules must be included.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						<strong>NOTE: Loose coupling</strong> is an <em>Object-oriented principle</em> in which each component of the system knows it's responsibility and don't care about the other components (or at least tries to not care about them as much as possible). Loosing coupling is a good thing because you can easily reuse the different modules. You're not coupled with the interfaces of other modules. Using publish/subscribe you're only coupled with the publish/subscribe interface which is not a big deal – just two methods. So if you decide to reuse a module in different project you can just copy and paste it and it'll probably work or at least you won't need much effort to make it work.

						JavaScript has a big design flaw, where it is very easy to create global variables that have the potential to interact in negative ways. The practice of namespacing is usually to create an object literal encapsulating your own functions and variables, so as not to collide with those created by other libraries:
					</p>
					<pre class="brush: js;"> 
						var MyApp = {
							isMobile: true,
						    foo: function() {
						    },
						    bar: function() {
						    }
						};					
					
						//	Then instead of calling foo() globally, it would always be called as:
						MyApp.foo();
						
						// Likewise, var1 always accessed as:
						MyApp.isMobile

						The biggest disadvantage is that the client must have JavaScript enabled and be powerful enough to run a fair amount of it. It's also harder to satisfy accessibility concerns or anything else that relies on parsing static HTML (though something knowing your specific API can probably do better than HTML scraping). Finally, it's easier to have significant memory leaks.
					</p>

					<p>
						As far as duplicating code or putting business logic on the client - I'm not sure how much of that you have to do. If the model on the client is a View-Model (a model that matches up with the world as the UI sees it, not a business model) then the logic that matches the ViewModel up to the business model can reside on the client, the server, or a bit of both. It depends on how you feel about having your API contain a client-specific facade vs. having the client translate UI inputs into API calls.

				<div class="accordion-inner">            
					<h5>
						WebSockets enables instant data exchange and is supported by all modern browsers. Put it to use immediately in your Web apps
					</h5>

					<h6>
					Determining whether to use WebSockets for the job at hand is simple:
					</h6>

					<ul>
						<li>
							Does your app involve multiple users communicating with each other?	
						</li>
						<li>
							Is your app a window into server-side data that's constantly changing?
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
					If you answered yes to either of these questions, consider using WebSockets. If you're still unsure and want some inspiration, here are a few killer use cases.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>1. Social feeds</strong>
					</p>
					<p>					
						One of the benefits of social apps is knowing what all your friends are doing when they do it. Sure, it's a little creepy, but we all love it. You don't want to wait minutes to find out a family member won a pie-baking contest or a friend has become engaged. You're online, so your feed should update in real time.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>2. Multiplayer games</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						The Web is quickly coming into its own as a gaming platform. Without having to rely on plug-ins (I'm looking at you, Flash) Web developers are now able to implement and experiment with high-performance gaming in the browser. Whether you're dealing with DOM elements, CSS animations, HTML5 canvas or you're experimenting with WebGL, efficient interaction between players is crucial. I don't want to discover my opponent has moved after I pull the trigger.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>3. Collaborative editing/coding</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						We live in the age of distributed dev teams. Working on a copy of a document used to suffice, but then you had to figure out a way to merge all the edited copies together. Version control systems like Git can help with certain files, but you'll still have to track people down when Git finds a conflict it can't deal with. With a collaborative solution like WebSockets, we can work on the same document and skip all the merges. It's easy to see who is editing what and if you're working on the same portion of a document as someone else.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>4. Clickstream data</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						Being able to analyze how users interact with your website is critical to improving it. The cost of HTTP has forced us to prioritize and collect only the most important data. Then, six months down the line, we realize we should've been collecting a different metric -- one that looked unimportant but would now shed light on a critical decision. With the overhead of HTTP requests out of the way, you can be less restrictive about the kind of data you're sending from the client. Want to track mouse movement in addition to page loads? Just send the data through a WebSocket connection to the back end and persist it in your favorite NoSQL store. (MongoDB is good for logging events like this.) Now you can play back customer interactions to see what was really going on.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>5. Financial tickers</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						The finance world moves fast -- microsecond fast. Our human brains can't keep up with processing data at that speed, so we write algorithms to do it for us. Even if you're not dealing with high-frequency trading, however, stale information can only hurt. When you have a dashboard tracking companies you're interested in, you want to know what they're worth now, not 10 seconds ago. Use WebSockets to stream that data and no one needs to wait.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>6. Sports updates</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						While we're on the topic of silly things people are passionate about, let's talk sports. I'm not a sports guy, but I know what sports guys want. When the Patriots are playing, my brother-in-law surrenders himself to the pace of the game. It's a trancelike state prone to violent, visceral reactions. I don't understand it, but I respect the intensity of the connection, so the last thing I want to do is add latency to his experience. If you're including sports information in your Web app, WebSockets can keep your users up to speed.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>7. Multimedia chat</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						While there's no substitute for holding a meeting in person, videoconferences are about as good as it gets when we can't get everybody in the same room. The videoconference route is plug-in heavy, though, and full of proprietary "goodness." I'm a fan of the open Web, so using WebSockets with getUserMedia API's and the HTML5 audio and video elements is an obvious win. WebRTC, the logical predecessor to the combination I just outlined, looks promising, but the lack of current browser support eliminates it as a candidate.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>8. Location-based apps</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						More and more developers are leveraging the GPS capabilities of mobile devices to make their Web apps location-aware. If you're tracking user locations over time (such as running an app that tracks your progress along a route), you'll be collecting fine-grained data. If you want to update a Web dashboard in real time (say, a track coach monitoring the progress of runners) HTTP is going to be unnecessarily bulky. Leverage the TCP connection a WebSocket uses and let that data fly.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>9. Online education</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						School keeps getting more expensive, while the Internet keeps getting faster and cheaper. Online education can be a great way to learn, especially if you can interact with teachers and other students. WebSockets is the natural choice, allowing for multimedia chat, text chat, and other perks like collaborative drawing on a digital communal chalkboard.

					<p>Single page applications are more capable of decreasing load time of pages by storing the functionality once it is loaded the first time, allowing easier data transfer between pages and a more complex user interface instead of trying to control so much from the server. This allows for more interference from an end user, but proper checks on the server eliminate pretty much all of that risk. Most end users won't attempt this, so that does not warrant much if any worry. Also, the processing of data can be moved into generic service handlers which could result in an architecture utilizing the following layers:</p>
						<ul class="list">
							<li>Database</li>
							<li>BL

								<ul class="list">
									<li>Transport Service</li>
									<li>Processing Service</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>User Interface The ajax functionality used allows for a smoother and more controlled user experience (my favorite perk)</li>
						</ul>
					
					<p>And as for handling large components, the benefit is that you have the option to deffer the load time to an ajax process and do so whenever you like, making the initial load faster.</p>

					<p>The process for coding it is a bit different in that using services is pretty much a requirement, but it is very similar to using a master page and controlling what content is loaded from the client.</p>

					<p>As for best practices, there are quite a few optimizations that could and should be made to a design implementation, such as storing information as it comes, loading in script, html and js files through ajax only when needed, and using data loaded on one page in another if it can be instead of reloading for each new "page".</p>

					<p>There is all sorts of information on this, and all sorts of libraries to use, but I would suggest using your own code as much as possible for the basic functionality(including the libraries you would typically use) and enhance from there.</p>

					<p>As a side note, I would suggest looking up concepts for designing for one web, such as media queries for adjusting content..</p>

					<p>I believe that this is the direction most websites should be moving in considering the number of devices that users utilize today, and the abilities and limitations of each.</p>
