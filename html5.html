						The difference between &lt;article&gt; and &lt;section&gt;
					</p>
					<p>
						There's been a lot of confusion over the difference (or perceived lack of a difference) between the <span class="bold">&lt;article&gt;</span> and <span class="bold">&lt;section&gt;</span> elements in HTML5. The &lt;article&gt; element is a specialised kind of &lt;section&gt;; it has a more specific semantic meaning than &lt;section> in that it is an independent, self-contained block of related content. We could use &lt;section&gt;, but using &lt;article&gt; gives more semantic meaning to the content.
					</p>
					<p>
						By contrast &lt;section&gt; is only a block of related content, and &lt;div&gt; is only a block of content. Also as mentioned above the pubdate attribute doesn't apply to &lt;section>. To decide which of these three elements is appropriate, choose the first suitable option:
					</pre>
					<ul>
						<li>Would the content would make sense on its own in a feed reader? If so use &lt;article&gt;</li>
						<li>Is the content related? If so use &lt;section&gt;</li>
						<li>Finally if there's no semantic relationship use &lt;div&gt;</li>
					</ul>

			 <div class="accordion-body collapse in" id="div-not-dead">
				<div class="accordion-inner">
					<p>
						Sorry, can you say that again?, I hear you ask. Certainly: you can still use &lt;div&gt;! Despite HTML5 bringing us new elements like &lt;article&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, and &lt;aside&gt;, the &lt;div&gt; element still has its place. Let the HTML5 Doctor tell you why.

					Status: Unchanged

					<p>
					In HTML 4, the <div> element was defined to be a generic element for structuring a page. Although you can allude to the nature of its content by assigning id and class attributes with meaningful names, a <div> has almost no semantic meaning. The HTML5 definitionis basically the same as in HTML 4:
					</pre>
					<pre class="brush: js;">
					The div element has no special meaning at all. It represents its children. It can be used with the class, lang, and title attributes to mark up semantics common to a group of consecutive elements.
